■ STRONY
  When rivctl captures a debug packet it creates
  a new "page" and appends it to the database
  Pages are important because they fit on the
  screen neatly and are much easier to search
  through than in a simple serial console (debug
  packets are not indexed).

  You can move between pages using [←→] keys.
  If you wish to see only the latest package hit
  a [l] key. Also you can navigate to specific
  page by pressing [n] key and entering your
  desired page number.

  There are some other things you can do with
  pages - they will be listed and explained in
  sections below.

■ PASEK GÓRNY
  ~ light-blue bar near the top of the screen ~
  Topbar is used for displaying actions relevant
  to current pane. Here is a short list of them:
  Tab   switch between 3 panes: regfile, datamem
        & progmem - currently selected pane will
        become highlighted (key: [Tab])
  Nav   jump to specified page. (key: [n])
  ▲▼    pane can be scrolled with [↑↓] keys
  Find  find an entry in the memory (key: [f])

  Apart from that, there is a simple page count
  with current page and a mode display. You can
  move between pages with left & right arrow
  keys. This will change mode from "latest" to
  "scroll", jumping to specific page will cause
  the same effect.

■ PASEK ZADAŃ
  ~ black bar near the bottom of the screen ~
  Taskbar consists of two parts. A small list of
  most basic actions will always be displayed.

  These actions are:
  [h]   display this help message
  [s]   save all collected pages as a sqlite3 .db
        file to a specified location
  [l]   always display latest page - you can break
        out of this mode by pressing left or right
        arrow key or by jumping to a specific page
  [q]   quit this program.

  Other than that, an UART status is shown on the
  right side of taskbar. Upon receiving data from
  the port a green indicator will flash briefly.
  Yellow indicator is always lit. The last element
  is an abbreviated device name.
